Items can be searched through the search bar by name or catalog number, or through the sectors and departments they are categorized under.

## Item page

All the pertinent item details are found on an item page. The item's name, catalog number, the sector and department it belongs to, the description, a photo, the models found in the army, its accessories, consumables are among the details shown. Any other items linked to the item at hand, for example a consumable, is shown as a hyperlink, and that allows the user to traverse through items to understand the whole "story" of a particular item - knowledge (that is public) that beforehand used to be solely at the hands of the Hanar department. This allows for increasing the efficiency at medical item procurement.
